Kaizen is developed by the Ateneo de Naga University Management Information Systems.

My design of this system is heavily inspired by the existing Kaizen design as I already ok with it, but I wanted to add UI elements from myADNU.
The highlights of my design are:

1. Slightly tweaked some colors following a color template from Adobe Color (https://color.adobe.com/search?q=blue%20gold) without straying too much from the University's color motiff.

2. Changed color of navigation side bar as I think a lighter theme fits better than the standard black color.

2. Redesigned home page with added "Important Announcements" as when I was using Kaizen, I find myself in need of important updates which can be found in myADNU.
	-Important Announcements may contain announcements from the CRO, particularly about the Advisement Schedule, updates, etc.
	- Every announcement has a header containing the subject of the announcement and right below that is the announcement itself.

3. I also made the "Logout" button easy to access as compared to the existing design wherein you'll need to click the arrow near the user name to logout

4. I also added a functionality to the username as it will be used to see your user profile.

5. Redesigned Advisement page
	- Streamlined design to focus more on what is essential; the information
	- Designed so that every text is clear and readable.

6. Minor redesign of the "About page" particularly in the color department.

7. Created a profile page inspired by the "My Profile" in myADNU
